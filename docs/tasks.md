# Tessitura PHP Library Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks to improve the Tessitura PHP library. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

**_These items_** have already been transferred to the backlog.

## Architecture and Design

- [x] Implement proper dependency injection throughout the codebase
- [x] Create interfaces for all major components to improve testability and flexibility
- [ ] Implement a proper exception hierarchy instead of using generic exceptions
- [x] Add a caching layer to reduce API calls and improve performance
- [ ] Implement a proper logging strategy with configurable log levels
- [ ] Create a configuration class to centralize configuration management
- [ ] Implement a proper service container for managing dependencies
- [ ] Add a rate limiting mechanism to prevent API throttling
- [ ] Implement a proper retry mechanism for failed API calls

## Code Quality

- [x] Standardize method naming conventions (choose either camelCase or snake_case consistently)
- [ ] Add comprehensive PHPDoc comments to all classes and methods
- [ ] Fix the version inconsistency in the Api class (property is '15', constructor default is '16')
- [ ] **_Improve error handling by using exceptions instead of trigger_error_**
- [x] Add type declarations to all method parameters and return types
- [ ] Implement proper null handling throughout the codebase
- [x] Remove magic methods where possible to improve IDE support and type safety
- [ ] Add validation for API credentials and other critical configuration
- [ ] Implement proper input validation for all public methods

## Testing

- [ ] Increase unit test coverage to at least 90%
- [ ] Add more integration tests for API interactions
- [ ] Implement test fixtures for all API responses
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Implement mutation testing to ensure test quality
- [ ] Add performance tests for critical operations
- [ ] Implement continuous integration with GitHub Actions or similar
- [x] Add static analysis tools to the CI pipeline

## Documentation

- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation with examples
- [ ] **_Add a getting started guide with installation and basic usage_**
- [ ] Document all available API endpoints and their parameters
- [ ] Add a troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Create a changelog to track version changes
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines for external contributors
- [ ] Document the authentication process in detail
- [ ] Add examples for common use cases

## Features

- [ ] Implement support for all Tessitura API endpoints
- [ ] Add support for pagination in API responses
- [ ] Implement a fluent interface for building API queries
- [ ] Add support for asynchronous API calls
- [ ] Implement webhooks support if available in the Tessitura API
- [ ] Add support for bulk operations to improve performance
- [ ] Implement a command-line interface for common operations
- [ ] Add support for different API versions

## Security

- [ ] Implement proper credential management (consider using environment variables)
- [ ] Add support for API tokens instead of basic authentication
- [ ] Implement request signing if supported by the Tessitura API
- [ ] Add CSRF protection for web applications using the library
- [ ] Implement proper input sanitization for all API parameters
- [ ] Add support for IP whitelisting if available in the Tessitura API
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Performance

- [ ] Optimize API calls to reduce response time
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for HTTP requests
- [ ] Add support for compressed API responses
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large responses
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for resource collections
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple operations
- [ ] Optimize JSON serialization/deserialization

## Maintenance

- [ ] Update dependencies to their latest versions
- [ ] Remove deprecated code and features
- [ ] Refactor complex methods to improve readability
- [ ] Add code quality metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning for releases
- [ ] Create a roadmap for future development
- [ ] Set up automated dependency updates
- [ ] Implement a proper release process
